The String Pool (also known as the String Intern Pool) in Java is a special memory area within the heap where string literals are stored. It optimizes memory usage and performance by ensuring that strings with the same content are not duplicated, but instead, a single instance is reused.

How the String Pool Works:
When you create a string using a literal (e.g., String s = "Hello";), Java checks if the string "Hello" already exists in the string pool:
If it exists, Java will return the reference to the existing string.
If it doesn't exist, the string "Hello" is added to the pool, and the reference is returned.
